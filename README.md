# Psychic-Game

This repo contains the files for a webpage that runs a number guessing game.  

Upon load, the user presses any key to initiate the program.  The user is given 9 attempts to match the computer's randomally generated number.  If the user matches, they are incrementally given a Win value.  If the user loses, they are given a Lose value.  

This repo was created for the Psychic Game homework assignment from the Coding Bootcampt cohort.
